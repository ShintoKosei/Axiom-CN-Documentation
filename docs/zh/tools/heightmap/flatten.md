# Flatten

The **Flatten** tool is best described as an elevation tool going in two directions. It raises terrain below it and lowers terrain above it, ultimately creating a flat spot where the cylinders meet which is where you point the brush. It can be used to flatten hilly areas to a desired height and to create steep edges on the sides of builds. Similarly to the **Elevation** tool it uses a brush that can have its height and radius configured.

The sharpness setting affects both the top and the bottom portion of the flatten tool. This means that a higher sharpness setting creates not only a sharper cliff edge but also lowers area around it more harshly.

Additionally there is a lock Y setting. Clicking this lets you lock to a specific height by right-clicking a block in the world, this then sets the lock to that height. What this does is it makes it so that no matter where you click, it will always flatten blocks to that height. This can be unlocked by clicking the button once more.
