# Enhanced Flight
The **Enhanced Flight** capability changes your normal creative mode flight to a more precise flight without any leftover momentum. It also allows you to move in the direction the camera is facing.

> Some users have mentioned that it took some time to get used to the enhanced flight, but once they did it improved their building experience dramatically. I'd recommend trying out the capability for at least a little bit to see if it suits your building workflow.
