# 功能
This chapter covers Capabilities, toggleable features which can enhance your building workflow.

The Capabilities that are currently available are:
- [Bulldozer](bulldozer.md) (break blocks fast)
- [Replace Mode](replacemode.md) (replace blocks in the world)
- [Force Place](forceplace.md) (bypass block placement restrictions)
- [No Updates](noupdates.md) (prevent block updates when placing/breaking)
- [Tinker](tinker.md) (various useful interactions when right-clicking with an empty hand)
- Infinite Reach (removes the reach limit)
- Fast Place (place blocks fast)
- Angel Placement (place blocks mid-air)
- No Clip (move through blocks while flying)

Capabilities can be toggled using the left side of the [Context Menu](builder/contextmenu.md)

Additionally, keybinds can be associated with capabilities to quickly toggle them. By default, only the [Replace Mode](capabilities/replacemode.md) has a keybind (R), but more can be added in the vanilla controls menu (Esc > Options > Controls)
