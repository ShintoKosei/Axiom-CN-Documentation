# Box Select

The **Box Select** tool allows you to create cuboid selections. To start, click and drag between two points. The selection can be further refined by repositioning the 3 [Gizmos](/editor/gizmos.md).

If you want to select between two known coordinates instead, these coordinates can be entered into the tool's options.
