# Melt

The **Melt** tool is a tool that uses a Gaussian blur to subtract mass from a surface. The best way to describe it is being the opposite of the **Weld** tool. Rather than flaring out edges or filling in seams it can be used to melt into or carve away at surfaces in a way that blends in with the existing terrain to make things like erosion patterns. It is partially configured using the brush settings and has a few more settings that change the algorithm in specific ways.

The Smoothing strength can be adjusted to make smoother melting paths, a higher smoothing setting means that the tool will need a lower threshold to operate as they constrain each other. Generally a higher smoothing strength will also increase the size of the affected area.

The Smoothing threshold can be adjusted to make it harder for the tool to affect a given area. This makes it possible to constrain the tool in a way that helps to create more natural looking carvings and erosion patterns.
