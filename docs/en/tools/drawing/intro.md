# Drawing Tools

Drawing tools are used to sculpt the world, adding or subtracting mass in a way similar to the sculpting tools found in other 3D software. Each tool uses unique placement algorithms, allowing for varied effects. Axiom provides a wide array of these tools, each one equipped with specialized configurations for precise block editing.
