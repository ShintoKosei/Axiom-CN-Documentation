# Builder Mode
The Builder Mode is an enhancement of the vanilla Creative mode. It adds several new features that take a lot of the pain away from traditional building and make everything just a bit easier.


## Builder Context Menu
Many features for builder mode can be toggled or accessed through the Context Menu. The menu can be opened by holding down Left Alt. See [Context Menu](builder/contextmenu.md) for more information.

## Builder Tools
To the right of the hotbar, you can find the Builder Tools. These tools are very simple and are intended to ease structural/small scale building where use of the more powerful [Editor Mode](editor/intro.md) is too unwieldly.

To start using a Builder Tool, scroll to the 10th slot or press 0.
To switch to a different Builder Tool, hold Left Alt and then scroll.

The tools that are currently available in this section are:
- [Move](/en/builder/move.md)
- [Clone](/en/builder/clone.md)
- [Stack](/en/builder/stack.md)
- [Smear](/en/builder/smear.md)
- [Extrude](/en/builder/extrude.md)
- [Erase](/en/builder/erase.md)
- [Setup Symmetry](/en/builder/setupsymmetry.md)
