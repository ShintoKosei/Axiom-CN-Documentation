# Setup Symmetry

Setup Symmetry allows you to position and configure a 'symmetry node'. Once the node is set up, you can use the 1-9 hotbar hotkeys to switch back and start placing blocks with symmetry.

## Setup

Begin by placing a node with right click

Add a 'flip modifier' using Ctrl+F

Add a 'rotation modifier' using Ctrl+R

The node can be removed at any time by pressing Delete/Backspace. The node can also be temporarily disabled by simply removing all the flip/rotation modifiers

Multiple modifiers can be used at the same time to achieve more complex symmetry

See below for a demonstration
