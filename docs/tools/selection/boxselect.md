# Box Select

The **Box Select** tool allows you to create cuboid selections. To start, click and drag between two points. The selection can be further refined by repositioning the 3 [Gizmos](/editor/gizmos.md).

If you want to select between two known coordinates instead, these coordinates can be entered into the tool's options.

> Warning: Some users try to use the tool by clicking twice. This does not work, you must drag to create the initial box
